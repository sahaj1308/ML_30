A live virtual makeup try-on to use makeup products

This project implements a virtual makeup try-on application using Python, OpenCV, MediaPipe, and Streamlit. The application allows users to virtually apply makeup products, such as lipstick, in real time. It leverages advanced facial landmark detection provided by MediaPipe to accurately place makeup on facial features.

The key features used in the project are:
Facial Landmark Detection: Utilizes MediaPipe for efficient and precise detection of facial landmarks, ensuring makeup is applied accurately.
Makeup Application: Uses OpenCV to overlay different types of makeup, such as lipstick, eyeshadow, blush, and foundation, on the detected facial landmarks.
Web Interface: Streamlit provides an easy-to-use web interface for users to upload their images and view the virtual makeup results instantly.

The makeup products provided are lipstick, foundation, eyeliner, kajal and eyebrow with a range of different colour shades.

RELEVANCE of this project:

Provides users with an interactive and engaging way to try on makeup without physical application, making the shopping experience more enjoyable and informative.
Allows users to experiment with different makeup looks, colors, and styles to find what suits them best, promoting personalization in beauty routines.
Acts as an innovative marketing tool for beauty brands to showcase their products and attract customers by offering a unique virtual try-on experience.
Makes makeup experimentation accessible to people who might be unable to visit stores physically due to geographical, health, or other reasons.
